
Interfaces
--------------------
An interface in java is a blueprint of class
Interface contains final and static variables
Interface contains abstract methods
An abstract method is a method contains definition but not body
Methods in interface are public by default
Interface supports the functionality of multiple inheritance.
we can define interface with interface keyword
A class extends another class, an Interface extends another Interface but a class implements an interface
We can create object reference for Interface but we cannot instantiate interface
Using interface, we can achieve multiple inheritence. As per java syntax, implements keyword supports multiple interfacess. but extends keyword doesn't support multiple classes.


Access Modifier's
---------------------
public    -> public are accessible from every where in the program
default   -> default access modifier are accessible only within the same package.
protected -> protected are accessible within same package or sub classes in different package though inheritence. 
private   -> private are accessible only within the class in which they are declared


Packages
---------------------
Package is collection of files (Classes/interfaces/any other files)
create sub package. new package -> name as Pack1\.pack2 (pack1/pack2/test.java)
Two types of packates:
1. user defined packages
2. built-in packages
